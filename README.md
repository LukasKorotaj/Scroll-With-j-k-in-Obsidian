# Scroll With j k in Obsidian
This Obsidian plugin allows for scrolling in preview mode with Vim-like keybindings. `j` and `k` for scrolling, as well as scrolling to top with `gg` and to bottom with `G`.

# How to use
The plugin doesn't have any settings. The only requirement for the plugin to work is to be in preview mode in Obsidian. 

# Idea behind the plugin
I edit all of my notes inside of Neovim and I found it quite annoying to have to switch to mouse when scrolling. I created this plugin to fix that problem.
